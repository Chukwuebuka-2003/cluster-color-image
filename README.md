# cluster-color-image
Exploring kmeans and image processing which demonstrates how to cluster and scale colors using the K-Means algorithm. 

## Introduction

This project focuses on color analysis, specifically color clustering and scaling. It is essential for tasks such as image segmentation, data visualization, and understanding color patterns.

## Features

- **Color Clustering**: Discover dominant colors in images by grouping similar hues together. This aids in image segmentation and identifying the most significant color themes.

- **Color Scaling**: Normalize colors to a common range, making them suitable for easy comparison and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chukwuebuka-2003/cluster-color-image.git
   ```

## Usage

The code is designed to be easily understandable and customizable. You can integrate it into your projects to gain insights from images or datasets.
